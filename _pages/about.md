Welcome to Yifan Wei (Eric)'s Personal Homepage!

I am a PhD student at the [Beihang University](https://scse.buaa.edu.cn/), School of Computer Science and Engineering. 
I have spent wonderful time at [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.ia.cas.cn/) as a master student, advised by Prof [Kang Liu](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/cip/~liukang/index.html).

My research interests lie in the field of natural language processing (NLP), with a focus on Large Language Models (LLMs), including Question Answering and Knowledge Editing. Currently, I am highly intrigued by exploring the intersection of LLMs and AI safety.
To date, I have authored three papers as the first author, which have been published at AI conferences including the CIKM, EMNLP, and AAAI,
with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Kmp8kVMAAAAJ'>google scholar citations </a> (<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Kmp8kVMAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).

[Neeko: Leveraging Dynamic LoRA for Efficient Multi-Character Role-Playing Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13717)

Xiaoyan Yu, Tongxu Luo, **Yifan Wei** *, Fangyu Lei, Yiming Huang, Hao Peng, Liehuang Zhu

[[PDF]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13717) [[ArXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13717) [[Code]](https://github.com/weiyifan1023/Neeko) 


We present Neeko, an innovative framework designed for efficient multiple characters imitation. Unlike existing methods, Neeko employs a dynamic low-rank adapter (LoRA) strategy, enabling it to adapt seamlessly to diverse characters.
