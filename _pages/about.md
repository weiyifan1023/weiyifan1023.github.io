Welcome to Yifan Wei (Eric)'s Personal Homepage!

I am a Ph.D. student at the [Beihang University](https://scse.buaa.edu.cn/), School of Computer Science and Engineering. 
I have spent wonderful time at [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.ia.cas.cn/) as a master student, advised by Prof [Kan Liu](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/cip/~liukang/index.html).

My research interests lie in the field of natural language processing (NLP), with a focus on Large Language Models (LLMs), including Question Answering and Knowledge Editing. Currently, I am highly intrigued by exploring the intersection of LLMs and AI safety.

[EX-FEVER: A Dataset for Multi-hop Explainable Fact Verification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.09754)

Huanhuan Ma, Weizhi Xu, **Yifan Wei**, Liuji Chen, Liang Wang, Qiang Liu, Shu Wu, Liang Wang

[[ArXiv]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.09754) [[Code]](https://github.com/dependentsign/EX-FEVER)

We introduce a large scale Multi-hop fact checking dataset with textual explanations, which can be used to evaluate the explainability of fact verification models.

[Neeko: Leveraging Dynamic LoRA for Efficient Multi-Character Role-Playing Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13717)

Xiaoyan Yu, Tongxu Luo, **Yifan Wei**, Fangyu Lei, Yiming Huang, Hao Peng, Liehuang Zhu

[[PDF]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13717) [[ArXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13717) [[Code]](https://github.com/weiyifan1023/Neeko) 


We present Neeko, an innovative framework designed for efficient multiple characters imitation. Unlike existing methods, Neeko employs a dynamic low-rank adapter (LoRA) strategy, enabling it to adapt seamlessly to diverse characters.

**Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2023**

We construct Multiple Sensitive Factors Time QA (MenatQA), which encompasses three temporal factors (scope factor, order factor, counterfactual factor) with total 2,853 samples for evaluating the time comprehension and reasoning abilities of LLMs.
