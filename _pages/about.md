Welcome to Xiaoyan Yu (Sunny)'s Personal Homepage!

I am a Ph.D. student at the [Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT)](https://www.bit.edu.cn/), School of Computer Science and Engineering. 
I received my master's degree at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences as a master's student, advised by Prof. Yongbin Zhou. During this time, I had a wonderful experience at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the guidance of Kang Liu and Shizhu He.

My research interests lie in the field of natural language processing (NLP), with a focus on Question Answering. Currently, I am highly intrigued by exploring the intersection of LLMs (Large Language Models) and data mining.
To date, I have authored two papers as the first author, which have been published at AI conferences including the CIKM, EMNLP, with total google scholar <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MgsexesAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>.

[DAMe: Personalized Federated Social Event Detection with Dual Aggregation Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00617)

Xiaoyan Yu, **Yifan Wei**, Pu Li, Shuaishuai Zhou, Hao Peng, Li Sun, Liehuang Zhu, Philip S Yu

[[ArXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00614) [[Code]](https://github.com/XiaoyanWork/DAMe) 

This paper proposes a personalized federated learning framework with a dual aggregation mechanism for social event detection, namely DAMe.

[Does Knowledge Localization Hold True? Surprising Differences Between Entity and Relation Perspectives in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00617)

**Yifan Wei**, Xiaoyan Yu, Yixuan Weng, Huanhuan Ma, Yuanzhe Zhang, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu

[[ArXiv]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00617) [[Code]](https://github.com/weiyifan1023/RaKE) 

This study investigates the differences between entity and relational knowledge through knowledge editing. Our findings reveal that entity and relational knowledge cannot be directly transferred or mapped to each other.

[Neeko: Leveraging Dynamic LoRA for Efficient Multi-Character Role-Playing Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13717)

**Xiaoyan Yu**, Tongxu Luo, Yifan Wei, Fangyu Lei, Yiming Huang, Hao Peng, Liehuang Zhu

[[PDF]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13717) [[ArXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13717) [[Code]](https://github.com/weiyifan1023/Neeko) 


We present Neeko, an innovative framework designed for efficient multiple characters imitation. Unlike existing methods, Neeko employs a dynamic low-rank adapter (LoRA) strategy, enabling it to adapt seamlessly to diverse characters.

**Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2023**

We construct Multiple Sensitive Factors Time QA (MenatQA), which encompasses three temporal factors (scope factor, order factor, counterfactual factor) with total 2,853 samples for evaluating the time comprehension and reasoning abilities of LLMs.
