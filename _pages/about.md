Welcome to Huanhuan Ma (Andy)'s Personal Homepage!

I am a master student at the [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.ia.cas.cn/) (expected to graduate in June 2024). Additionally, I am a member at the [Center for Research on Intelligent Perception and Computing (CRIPAC)](http://cripac.ia.ac.cn/en/EN/volumn/home.shtml), National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR). I am fortunate to be advised by [Qiang Liu](https://john-qiangliu.tech/) and [Liang Wang](http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/users/liangwang/).

My research interests lie in the field of natural language processing (NLP), with a focus on fake information detection, including fact verification and out-of-context detection. Currently, I am highly intrigued by exploring the intersection of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI safety.

I have spent wonderful time at [BAAI](https://www.baai.ac.cn/english.html), and [NC State](https://dongkuanx27.github.io/page-lab.html) as a research intern/assistant.

[EX-FEVER: A Dataset for Multi-hop Explainable Fact Verification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.09754)

**Huanhuan Ma**, Weizhi Xu, Yifan Wei, Liuji Chen, Liang Wang, Qiang Liu, Shu Wu, Liang Wang

[[ArXiv]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.09754) [[Code]](https://github.com/dependentsign/EX-FEVER)

We introduce a large scale Multi-hop fact checking dataset with textual explanations, which can be used to evaluate the explainability of fact verification models.

[Interpretable Multimodal Out-of-Context Detection with Soft Logic Regularization](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10447706/)

**Huanhuan Ma<sup>\*</sup>**, Jinghao Zhang<sup>\*</sup>, Qiang Liu, Shu Wu, Liang Wang

**IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP) 2024**

We introduce a novel multimodal out-of-context detection framework with soft logic regularization, which can effectively detect out-of-context information with interpretability.
